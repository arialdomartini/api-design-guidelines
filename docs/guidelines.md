REST API Design Guidelines
==========================

A well designed Web API should aim to support:

* [Platform independence](platform-independence.md): clients should be able to consume the API regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This is obtained by using [standard protocols](standard-protocols.md).
* Service evolution: the Web API should be able to evolve and add functionalitiy independently from client applications. This is obtained by using [versioning](versioning.md). All the functionalities should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it. This is obtained by [documenting the API](documenting.md).
